# Rockbuster Stealth LLC - Business driven solutions through SQL queries
## Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 
## The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their following year company strategy. Every file will contain answers using SQL queries to a series of business questions.
### Every assignment of the project will be described in the files belonging to this repository
